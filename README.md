# MSFS2020-livery-megapack Reanimated
Livery Megapack was abandoned in 2021, and we're going to repair it. 
Since it was abandoned, Sim Update 5 came out and broke a lot of the liveries, as the way they handle fallback directories changed. 
So, we're going to repair them all and re release them for free.
