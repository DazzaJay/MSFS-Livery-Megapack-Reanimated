# MSFS2020-livery-megapack Reanimated
Livery Megapack was abandoned in 2021, and we're going to repair it. 
Since it was abandoned, Sim Update 5 came out and broke a lot of the liveries, as the way they handle fallback directories changed. 
So, we're going to repair them all and re release them for free.

# We are NOT currently taking livery requests. We are focusing on the following:
# 1. Fix the "Pink Textures" bugs added in Sim Update 5. 
# 2. Remove all fixed tail numbers, make sure Tail Numbers are user configurable.
# 3. Add Float / Snow Ski variants of all applicable planes.
# 4. Other Fixes.
