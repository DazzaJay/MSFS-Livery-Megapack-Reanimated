# MSFS2020-livery-megapack Reanimated
Livery Megapack was abandoned in 2021, and we're going to repair it. 
Since it was abandoned, Sim Update 5 came out and broke a lot of the liveries, as the way they handle fallback directories changed. 
So, we're going to repair them all and re release them for free.

# We are NOT currently taking livery requests. We are focusing on the following:
# 1. Fix the "Pink Textures" bugs added in Sim Update 5. 
Pink textures are caused by missing or incorrect fallbacks in the texture.cfg file for each livery.
The correct fallbacks are lited here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V2k6cFaXAhKOHwaALZ2LaSbiRx8W_vwgGW4mM9CX6po/edit?usp=sharing
# 2. Remove all fixed tail numbers, make sure Tail Numbers are user configurable.
# 3. Add Float / Snow Ski variants of all applicable planes.
# 4. Other Fixes.
